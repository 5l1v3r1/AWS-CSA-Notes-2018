# AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Notes 2018

Curated documentation/study notes on going through the [Udemy, Certified Solutions Archictect - Associate 2018](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/) course. These notes are to help myself, as well as, anyone else going through this same course study and prepare for the exam. Thanks!

## My Study Practice

While planning out my study schedule, I felt it would be necessary to watch one section a week, starting with Section 2: 1000 ft overview, followed up by 6 days of review (1 - 2 hours a day) solidifying everything I learned. This seems to work for me but might be either too slow or fast for someone else. That's OK! Learn at your own pace until you feel comfortable with the concepts, practices and information given!

## The Exam Blueprint

As of 2018, you are now given the option taking either the **Standard Solutions Architect Associate Exam** or the **BETA Solutions Architect Associate Exam**! Let's have a look at the differences...
